# Flocking Behavior Simulation with THREE.js

This repository contains an implementation of the flocking behavior algorithm using [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. The flocking algorithm simulates the movement of a group of entities (boids) that behave similarly to a flock of birds, a school of fish, or a swarm of insects.
